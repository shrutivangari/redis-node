# NodeJs Concepts:

## Prototype
All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype. The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain. Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

## Callback
A function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing. In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by another functions. Functions that do that are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function
